      This is the story of Kevin Z. who joined Pursuit in Queens, New York to learn how to write code.
      He goes to class Monday-Wednesday nights and weekends. He prefers to use PC computers vs. Macs.
      He is a smart cookie who loves to troubleshoot his classmates' code. Kevin loves to sit at his
      favorite seat (right side from screen towards the back). One day, a random asian girl named Van sat next to him.
      They became cohort buddies. She tests Kevin's patience everyday and bring him unhealthy snacks to make up for it. His favorite
      snack are potato chips. Some days, he likes to eat other snacks, but potato chips are the main go. Besides Van,
      he loves sitting with his other table buddies Alex, Yun, and Jen. They connect by bringing snacks with each
      other. Kevin is excited to continue his Pursuit's journey (with Van)!

    <p>Thank you for being Kevin's friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart is true, you're a pal and a
      confidante. And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me
      and
      the card attached would say,
    </p>
    <h3>Thank You For Being Kevin's Friend!</h3>
